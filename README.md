Yup
Uh
We bake the cakes up and serve 'em fresh (smell that?)
You on a crash course for certain death
Wall candy, Eames chairs on Persian rugs (yeah)
Whole body in the pot when I'm turning drugs (whole body)
Spinmaster like Jazzy Jeff (the Magnificent)
Candy paint the 'Vette, Yokohama tires, I'm Mannie Fresh
They call me the saucier (me)
I'm at the table at the Taj, 250K it cost to play
Fuck around and get tossed away (shh)
Talk dirty, we freshen up your breath, no Binaca spray (not that)
COD, we do not accept a check (don't accept that)
Crack a blank tape open and press the rec (press that)
Keep the vocals with less effect
If I'm not the coldest, whoever you consider is, I'm neck to neck
Don't get mad, get perpendicular (go up)
Doing donuts, we swerving the vehicular (nyow)
Free detail on the shirt is particular (you see me)
Passport tatted, I'm doing work as a visitor (yeah)
I'm jet-settin'
Takin' the chips off the table'll be your best bettin' (best bet)
Sendin' 'em back like the package had no address headin' (where you at?)
All you saw was a sugar flash when the 'Vette jetted
He was a product of his environment as well
He just chose and it was his right to choose how he wanted to live his life
You niggas stock pickin' (man), I'm on a yacht chillin' (damn)
We be hoppin' out black cars with lights flickin' (uh)
Got one stone worth a 550
The 40 cool, but they're non-consistent (man)
Did it cool, at the diamond district (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You know my price is different, life is different, ice is different
Come on, bro, you know we're tired of that same shit (same shit)
Hit the- two times, then I lane switch
Eating dinner out in London, tipped the valet a hundun (good job, you're doing good)
Man, I'm thinking long-term capital
I rock a plat Rollie so casual (uh)
And my assets still tangible (uh)
I'm taking East Coast girls to Calistoga
Let her take a ride in the 'Rari, I rock the gold one (check)
The streets coulda ate me alive, it made me stronger (man)
I went so hard for this shit, it made me colder (damn)
Twenty G's just for the rug, but that's normal (man)
Putting in work every day, I'm still hungry, uh (yeah)
Band Antonio
Okay, I guess they want a verse from the sensei
Most these niggas like ointment, Bengay
You pull a muscle in your back tryna pick up my safe (true)
My mansion big, it take two people to pick up a vase
It's wartime, and I'm war-ready
I got cash invested, cash in the bank, and I got cash handy
I heard Rashad or Troy talk about the tax levy
If I ain't handle my business, I'd be back peddlin'
If I ain't open up a business, I'd be backpeddlin'
Crack peddlin', black felon, pack sellin'
Crap shooter, buck a seven, I'm screaming, "Hallelujah"
Packed a Ruger way before I was a college student
See, I'm the kid that the trap recruited
It saw the hustle in me early, and I must salute it
I gun saluted, know niggas that did drive-bys and bust a U-ey
A thin line between flewed out and prostitutin'
I fuck her with my tool out (tool out)
I get bored, I buy a new house (new house)
Of properties, multiple VCs
On this track, you heard me talk multiple feces, you hear me?
A Southside Sunday cruisin', pull up to Henry's
Everything I do is big, Wemby
God got a plan
Got people behind me like the Verizon man, praying for a thousand grams
